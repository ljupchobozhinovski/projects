The main purpose of this Project was to develop a web page for “Doniraj Kompjuter – Donate PC”,. This is  a non-government organization that collects computers and computer parts through donations, repairs them and then donates them to children who cannot afford one.

At this phase the web page is not responsive, but it is on my to-do list.

This Project was made using Next.js (version 12.1) and mainly Bootstrap, Styled components and plain CSS. I managed to create Internationalization, the web page is translated in 3 languages.
As for setting the Server, I used Node/Express.
